# Simple To-Do App with LocalStorage Persistence

A basic to-do application built with React.js that utilizes LocalStorage to persist tasks across browser sessions.

## Features

-   Add new tasks to the to-do list.
-   Delete tasks from the list.
-   Tasks are saved in LocalStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
-   Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

-   React.js
-   HTML
-   CSS (or your preferred styling method)
-   LocalStorage API

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd [your-project-directory]
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
